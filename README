ndnSIM code with mapme implementations


we have mainly extended the official ndnSIM 2.1 code with our own implementations of mapme, KITE, anchor-based mobility management protocol.
In particular, we have implmentated:
    1) a mapme forwarder (NFD/daemon/fw/forwarder-mapme.h{c}pp)
    2) a kite forwarder (NFD/daemon/fw/forwarder-kite.h{c}pp)
    3) anchor-based forwarder (forwarder-anchor.h{c}pp)
as well as other utility codes for metrics computations and other functionalities.
